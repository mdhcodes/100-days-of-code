Today's Progress:

    I continued to research my new project and determined how I may implement it. 
    
    This project will reflect an actual museum visit where users select random art or search for specific criteria that will be displayed in a 3D building. Users will then navigate through the rooms to view the artwork or opt to view the work in list format. 

    1. Find resources to implement project.

    2. Update README.md  

    3. Share/Post project on PyLadies SOFLO Discord Channel  

Challenges:

    This is my first time creating a 3D environment and possibly gathering API data from AWS. The Smithsonian data is also organized in an edan content repository which is a new concept for me. I chose this project to challenge myself and I'm looking forward to overcoming any challenge I may face.
