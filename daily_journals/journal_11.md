Today's Progress:

    1. Learning With Nature:  
        Continue to research how to upload files from the user. The following errors persist:
        JS console errors:
        - Edit Image Saved: C:\fakepath\testing.jpg
        - Edit DocFile Saved: C:\fakepath\testing.pdf

        Python/Django terminal errors:
        - django.utils.datastructures.MultiValueDictKeyError: 'image'
        - django.utils.datastructures.MultiValueDictKeyError: 'doc-file'

    2. Read Think Python


Challenges:

    Uploading user files: 
        - capturing the data through JavaScript
        - understanding how to set/name the path to store the file uploads
