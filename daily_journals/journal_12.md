Today's Progress:

    1. Learning With Nature:  
        Solved the fake path error - C:\fakepath\testing.jpg and C:\fakepath\testing.pdf
        **SOLUTION** https://davidwalsh.name/fakepath - Remove the fake path
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file#value
        This is a security feature - "The value is always the file's name prefixed with C:\fakepath\, which isn't the real path of the file. This is to prevent malicious software from guessing the user's file structure."

Challenges:

    Passing form data to views.py and the database. These Python/Django terminal errors persist:
        - django.utils.datastructures.MultiValueDictKeyError: 'image'
        - django.utils.datastructures.MultiValueDictKeyError: 'doc-file'
