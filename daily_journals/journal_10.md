Today's Progress:

    1. Continue working on Learning With Nature to solve RawPostDataException. I eliminated the error and I'm able to edit a lesson via the admin path uploading text and files.  Updated models.py.

    2. Read Think Python
        Function parameters are placeholders set when function is defined.
        Function arguments are values passed when function is called/invoked/executed.

Challenges:

    Determine how to access and save files uploaded by the user.
