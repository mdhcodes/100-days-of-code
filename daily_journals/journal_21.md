Notes:

    Learning With Nature: Future Development 

    When a user requests to save a lesson, check the database to make sure that lesson hasn't already been saved by the user. Display message if this condition is true.

    When a user clicks on the title (which is a link) of a saved lesson, display the complete lesson stored in the database with all edits.

    When a user clicks to edit a saved lesson that has already been updated, display the form with the current data for the form fields. 

    At present, if a user makes a request and proceeds to make another request without clicking the 'logo' or 'Find Parks by State', the visible divs do not clear and new content is added below. How to clear a page when a new request is made without deleting or removing divs or refreshing the page. The user should not have to go back to the beginning to clear the page for a fresh start. 

    Remove lessons app that is not being used in the program.

    Clicking on the username should load the user's profile information allowing user to change their password.
