Today's Progress:  

    1. After receiving some technical advice, I've decided to develop two versions of Virtual Museum Visit. The first will be the web based version with Python, Django, and JavaScript. Then I will create a more interactive/immersive experience after I've done more research into WebXR, Open Source Mozilla hubs, and Mud Foundation (https://mud.foundation/).   

    After further investigation, I'll determine exactly what I wish to accomplish and plan my path forward. Thank you Evgeniya!
