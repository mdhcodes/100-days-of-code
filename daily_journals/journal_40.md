            Click a park link
            Click 'Saved Lessons'
                Click a lesson title - should display only current Park Learning Links (If a 'Park Link' search occurred before clicking on 'Saved Lessons' and then clicking on a 'Saved Lesson Title', the #park-learning div is not cleared and two results are displayed.)

How to clear a page when a new request is made without deleting or removing divs or refreshing the page. The user should not have to go back to the beginning to clear the page for a fresh start.
