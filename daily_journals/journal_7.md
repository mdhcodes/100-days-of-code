Today's Progress:  

    1. Research how to get data / make requests for data from Smithsonian API via AWS
    API request to AWS - https://smithsonian-open-access.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/metadata/edan/index.txt  
        Each Museum is listed as follows:  
        https://smithsonian-open-access.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/metadata/edan/[museaum_code]/index.txt files.  

        Each museum index.txt file contains multiple resources within as follows:  
        https://smithsonian-open-access.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/metadata/edan/[museaum_code]/[coded files from 00-...].txt  

        Opening the file above provides the JSON data  

    2. Read Think Python  

Challenges:  

    Overcame a challenge - I understand how to follow the .txt links on AWS to JSON data / resources. However, I'll need to determine how to search these SI AWS .txt files and get data / make requests for this data using Python.  
        How to search specific museums, topics/subjects, artifacts, 2D art, 3D art, etc.
