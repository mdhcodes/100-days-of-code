Today's Progress:  

    1. Determine if I can access Smithsonian Open Access resources/data on AWS directly as more data is available on AWS.  
        https://registry.opendata.aws/smithsonian-open-access/  

        https://smithsonian-open-access.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/metadata/edan/index.txt  

        https://github.com/Smithsonian/OpenAccess  
        
        https://github.com/datajango/smithsonian  
        
        https://edan.si.edu/openaccess/docs/  


    4. Install requests - python -m pip install requests  

    5. Continue to research how to create a 3D space in python and javascript.  

    6. Continue to research how to make images of different sizes fill the same size container in bootstrap - mdhCodes.com and Learning with Nature.  
         
    7. Read Think Python          

Challenges:  

    I'm not able to get information from AWS. Will continue to research. I'm also having difficulty making images appear to be the same size.
