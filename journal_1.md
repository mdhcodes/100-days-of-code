Today's Progress:

    I joined PyLadies SOFLO MeetUp for the 100 Days of Code Kickoff Party. I selected a new project and identified resources to implement my idea during this challenge. I then set up the initial structure and pushed it to GitHub.com. 

    1. Create a directory to store the Django project and app (virtual-museum-visit)  

    2. Create a virtual environment  

    3. Install Django in virtual environment  

    4. Initialize Git environment  
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/  

    5. Create project - django-admin startproject museums  

    6. Create app - python manage.py startapp virtualVisit  
    
    7. Setup directory structure  
    8. Create .gitignore  
    https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github  

    9. Create a new repository on GitHub  

    10. Push local code to new GitHub repository  

    11. Add README.md
